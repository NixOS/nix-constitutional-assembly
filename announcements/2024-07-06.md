# Constitutional Assembly: Interim Nixpkgs committer delegation team

To [ensure the continued delegation](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/435724-governance/topic/New.20nixpkgs.20onboarding.20process/near/446222942) of Nixpkgs commit access, we're appointing a new interim team:
- @Mic92
- @NickCao
- @jtojnar

This team is given the responsibility and authority of changing the list of [Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nixpkgs-committers).

We're letting this team define their own process, with some basic requirements:
- The process must be publicly documented, the initial process is documented [here](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixpkgs-committers.md)
- Any change to the process must be unanimously agreed upon by all delegation team members

Furthermore we give the recommendation to keep the process simple, since it is expected to need changes as we move towards defining the bigger picture of a community-based governance.
