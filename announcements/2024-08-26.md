## Nix Community Values Updates; to be finalised on 2024-09-02

(The values are being revised with approval from the entire assembly, but the words in this update come from me personally, @infinisil, as one of the assembly members)

We thank everybody for their private and public feedback for the above community values draft. Based on the feedback we've made some changes to them, which are summarised below, and can also be viewed [here](FILLME). We plan to finalise the [latest state](FILLME) on 2024-09-02, so [let us know](https://github.com/nixos/nix-constitutional-assembly?tab=readme-ov-file#feedback-and-ideas) if you have any last concerns.

Here's the summary of the changes:
1. Respect and civility: Added
   > We prioritise project health over individual interests
2. Automation over process and toil: Added
   > Automation reduces toil, but people are still accountable for it.
3. People come first: Replaced "companies" with "organisations":
   > Organisations gain prestige by funding the work of individuals and providing resources to support the project.
4. Automation over process and toil: Added a footnote for "toil":
   > [Toil](https://web.archive.org/web/20240717145635/https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) is work that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, interrupt-driven, devoid of enduring value, and scaling linearly with growth.
5. Automation over process and toil: Replaced "attention" with "time and energy":
   > We build automation and processes that make the best use of our contributors' limited time and energy.

PS: Stay tuned, soon we'll publish a constitution draft!
