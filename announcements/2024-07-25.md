# Constitutional Assembly: New interim GitHub org owner

Since the current GitHub org owners are constrained in their availability, we're appointing a new interim GitHub org owner from the NCA to help out: @lassulus. He will be responsible for unblocking contributors by receiving requests to change anything about the GitHub organisation in the new [GitHub org owners help desk Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#org_owners:nixos.org), and either acting upon them or forwarding them to the right person.

The list of all GitHub org owners will newly be documented [here](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/github.md).

For feedback and ideas for the NCA, please [reach out](https://github.com/nixos/nix-constitutional-assembly?tab=readme-ov-file#feedback-and-ideas).
