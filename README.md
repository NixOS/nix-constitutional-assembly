# Nix Constitutional Assembly

The Nix Constitutional Assembly (NCA) is a group of people tasked with establishing a community-based governance structure for Nix that is capable of serving the community's needs.

This repository is used for mutable persistent public documents about and by the NCA.

## Members

The following people have [been appointed](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-constitutional-assembly-appointment/45504) as the NCA by the NixOS Foundation (alphabetically):

## Mission

The NCA's basic mission as [given by the board](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/board-update-2-assembly-appointment-process/45048#assembly-mission-and-goal-6) is to set up a governance structure, run by the community, that is capable of serving the community’s needs.
The following baselines have been given:
- The resulting governance structure needs to accommodate all official Nix resources including code, policies, websites, accounts, infrastructure, trademarks, finances, etc.
- While the NCA is free to choose any form or structure that they think is best for the project, they must ensure that the resulting governance structure’s decisions are representative of the entire community.
  This also requires defining what the community is.
- The resulting governance structure should be expected to provide stability to the community for the next 5 years.

As [indicated by the board](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/board-update-2-assembly-appointment-process/45048#assembly-lifetime-7), once the new governance structure is approved by the board, the NCA enters a transitory period to support the execution of the structure before finally disbanding.

To give us a reasonable timeline and set expectations for the wider community, we are **targeting our work to be done by 2024-09-01**.

## Communication

### Updates

To give updates or ask for community input, the NCA makes announcements on [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/constitutional-assembly/54), which you can get notifications for by clicking the bell icon.
The announcements are also mirrored to [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/437619-assembly-announcements).

If you have questions for the NCA, you can either:
- Ask the [members](#members) privately
- Ask publicly in the [Q&A](./qna.md)

### Feedback and ideas

The NCA collects feedback and ideas from various spaces.

This includes public spaces such as:
- Community discussions on [Zulip](./zulip/README.md) in the [governance channel](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/435724-governance)
- Open calls: For updates and Q&A, occasionally announced as necessary, past meeting notes [here](./calls)
- Personal office hours: For a more personal chat with individual assembly members, some hold regular [office hours](./office-hours.md)

Furthermore, since public spaces don't work for everybody, you can also reach out to the [members](#members) privately, and the NCA may also reach out to some people as needed.

#### Interview

We have also been privately interviewing project contributors with predefined questions.
If you'd like to give us your input in such a form, feel free to fill out the [interview template](./interview-questions.md) and send it to any of the [NCA members](#members).
Feel free to add what you want to add as a postscriptum!
