# Office hours

To have a more personal avenue for questions and feedback, some NCA members will hold personal weekly office hours.
If you have any concerns and/or want to connect with us, feel free to join!
To keep these calls smaller, we ask you to only join at most one per week.

The time slots are
- Ryan Trinkle / @ryantrinkle: Monday [14:00 UTC](https://time.is/1400_in_UTC)
- Silvan Mosberger / @infinisil: Tuesday [19:00 UTC](https://time.is/1900_in_UTC)
- Michael Raskin / @7c6f434c: Wednesay [21:00 UTC](https://time.is/2100_in_UTC)
- @lassulus: Thursday [16:00 UTC](https://time.is/1600_in_UTC)
